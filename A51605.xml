            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ever more cauſe to complaine,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.1.</note> (Brethren) then now, <hi>Who hath beleeved our report, and to whom hath the arme of the Lord been revealed?</hi> It is applied to our Saviours own preaching, whom very few received. But there the obſtruction lay altogether in the hearts of the people; they were locked up againſt the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus as by other things, ſo eſpecially by this, their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and ſeeking honour one of another. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelfe was not guilty. No marvel if we have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59506:5"/>
more cauſe now to complaine (Brethren,) then he then; for there is a double bar: one in the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the other in the hearts of the Preachers: this ſeeking honour one of another, makes our chariot wheels drive ſo heavily, the work of Chriſt go on ſo ſlowly. I deſire therefore this day to act the part of the Baptiſt, to prepare the way of the Lord, to endeavour to level one of the mountaines of our hearts, and ſwellings of our ſpirits, which is the great hindrance of beleeving, as you have it plainly in the Text.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour being now come into the world, added a new Article to their Creed, that they muſt beleeve in Jeſus already come,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.24.</note> and that he was the Meſſiah: That I am he, except ye beleeve it, you ſhall die in your ſins. The Jews could not receive him, would not come unto him, that they might have life. Our Saviour at once reproveth them for their unbelief, and layeth down ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral grounds wherefore they ſhould beleeve. Not only his own witneſſe;<note place="margin">Ver. 35.</note> but <hi>the witneſſe of John,</hi> whom they all took to be a Prophet ſent of God, and he owned him by ſending unto him, to know if he were the Meſſias,<note place="margin">Ver. 36.</note> and they rejoyced in his light for a time. As alſo the works he wrought teſtified of him,<note place="margin">Ver. 37.</note> yea the Father himſelfe did teſtifie to him, partly by theſe works, partly by the rejoycing of the Angels at his birth, and partly at his Baptiſme by that voice from heaven: <hi>This is my beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> This our Saviour ſpoke, that they might be ſaved: though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them, yet he tendred their poore ſoules. But alas all would not do! Life could not be conveyed to them from the Lord, becauſe the pipe was choaked up; they could not beleeve, they could not receive him, <hi>ver</hi> 43. And he deales faithfully with them, tells them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59506:5"/>
what is the reaſon, the root of their unbelief, or the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance; Becauſe they ſought honour and glory one of another, and not the honour which is only from the Lord. As if our Saviour had ſaid, it is an impoſſible thing, you ſhould beleeve, while it is thus with you. The interrogation affirmative, implies a ſtrong negative; as is moſt familiar in Scripture.</p>
            <p>There is not much difficulty in the words. They are in their nature, our Saviours aſſignation of one of the grand cauſes of their unbelief, in that they received ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour one of another, and not the glory only which is of God. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a participle, is taken <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaliter,</hi> as I could give you other inſtances in the new Teſtament; ſeeing that you receive honour of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Receiving of honour here Brethren, is not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to be underſtood of an admitting of honour and praiſe from others; or the ſuffering of themſelves to be well ſpoken of: but it is meant of a catching at it, by hunting after it; a deſire, a hunger, a thirſt after ſuch things as theſe are. Therefore ſome read it <hi>captantes,</hi> not <hi>accipientes,</hi> and the antitheſis cleareth it in this verſe, [and ſeek not the praiſe or glory which is only from God.] Not ſeeking of the glory which is of God, and ſeeking honour one of another, uſually go together. If the one be followed, the other is neglected. And ſo, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. I receive not teſtimony from men, but theſe things I ſay, that ye might be ſaved. Not that he did not admit <hi>Johns</hi> Teſtimony he there ſpeaks of; but he did not <hi>captare,</hi> he needed it not, ſought not after it; only this he ſpeaks for their ſakes, becauſe they had a good eſteem of <hi>John,</hi> and ſo his teſtimony might be of force with them; and ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 41. I receive not honour from men; not that he did not admit men
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59506:6"/>
to ſpeak well of him: though ſometimes he did charge them ſtraightly they ſhould not ſpeak, yet ſometimes he did admit them to ſpeak of him, and to His honour; but he catched not at it, he ſought it not, and in this ſenſe we take it here.</p>

                  <hi>The ſeeking honour from men, with the neglect of that honour whi h is of God, is a great impediment to our faith; or a great reaſon why poor creatures do not beleeve. How can you beleeve, ſeeing you receive honour, ſeek honour one of another?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two conſiderations eſpecially wherein the truth of this will appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, when the way of Chriſt is perſecuted, when Religion is a reproach,<note place="margin">Iſa. 59.15.</note> and he that departeth from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, maketh himſelfe a prey, as the Prophet ſpeakes: then the deſire of honour among men, keepeth them off from beleeving, and cloſing with him. This was the great ſtumbling block in the Jews way. Why did not they beleeve? We know the way of truth was diſgraced, Jeſus Chriſt came in ſuch a meane manner, He was born in a ſtable, had a manger for his cradle, becauſe there was no roome for Chriſt in the Inne. He had a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter for his ſuppoſed father, He had not a houſe to put his head in, and is this like to be the Meſſiah? What? he whom they afterward crucified? is this like to be the Deliverer, and Saviour of his people? The Jews would have beleeved, if their great men, or their Rulers had believed in him, ſo that there might have been any credit by it.</p>
               <p>There was a double danger did ariſe from their ſeeking honour of men;</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59506:6"/>1. This carnal affection did bribe their underſtandings, that they could not ſee the Lord Jeſus to be the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias; they were all for pomp and glory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not beleeve, nor be convinced, that ſuch a diſgraced perſon ſhould be the Meſſias. It is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all corrupt affections, to bemiſt and cloud the underſtanding, ſo that conviction is hindred by that meanes. If any other come in his own name, ſaith our Saviour, if it be but the way to honour, if a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and eſteemed among you, him you will receive. What was the reaſon, the people did not ſee the errour of the falſe prophets?<note place="margin">Jer 5.31.</note> alas they did love to have it ſo.</p>

On the other hand doubtleſſe, there is as great a danger, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſhould eat up faith.

If the Lord Jeſus had come as the Jews had expected him to come, as a great and glorious Prince with power to raiſe them, advance them (as the Diſciples them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did dreame of ſuch honours) he had not ſo few followers in his low eſtate, as he would have had many if he had been otherwiſe; but amongſt thoſe many, I doubt there would have been few ſound ones; for their deſire of honour, and reſpect among men, would have made them cloſe with him to profeſſe him, though their hearts were altogether ſtrangers to him,<note place="margin">Joh, 6.26.</note> as thoſe that followed for the loaves in another caſe.

our condition at preſent, becauſe now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt is rolled away in great part: and it is rather a reproach, to be a prophane wretch, and to have no profeſſion of Chriſt. Every one will now profeſſe, but in the meane time, while they are acted by ſuch a deſire, and ſeeking honour of men, that (being the great inducement) and matter not the glory which is of God only, they cannot beleeve. How can you beleeve indeed, whatever profeſſion you make? for as a man may beleeve, and not profeſſe, ſo may a man (and doubtleſſe many do) profeſſe, that never beleeved; and upon this very reaſon in theſe dayes.

                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The firſt I ſhall take from the very nature of faith, which is to empty the creature. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world more ſelf-emptying, then Faith is;<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>I live,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> Who had a greater Faith then the Apoſtle? and who was leſſe in his own eyes? A man never comes to know himſelf to purpoſe, until he believes. Before, he thought himſelfe to be ſomething, and ſought honour of men as well as the reſt of the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> but when he came to believe, all this vaniſhed; then nothing you have from him but <hi>the greateſt of ſinners,</hi> and the leaſt of Saints.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.15.</note> And though he laboured more abundantly then the reſt; yet <hi>not he, but the grace of God in him:</hi> and he is nothing,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.10.</note> when all is done. Oh, when a poore ſoul cometh to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the height, and depth, and breadth, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59506:8"/>
length of the love of Chriſt towards him; then he comes to ſee the dimenſions of his ſinnes to purpoſe, then he abhors himſelfe in duſt and aſhes.</p>
               <p>Faith is one of the wonders of the world indeed. For as the Lord hangs the world upon nothing, only his word of command, bidding it ſtand there, therefore it is immovable and beares all that weight we can poſſibly adde unto it, if we could adde any more then is of it ſelfe and from it ſelf: ſo it is in faith; it is founded upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the creature, and yet beares up all: though never ſo many temptations, corruptions, aſſaults, fightings without, terrours within; yet faith, though founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing, beares up all. Now ambition or deſire of honour, and ſeeking of it among men, is directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the very nature of faith: for it being an act of the will and affections, it would be ſomething in it ſelf, and faith would be nothing in it ſelf: therefore (I ſay) as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries deſtroy one another, ſo do theſe. Make a white wall black, the whiteneſſe is gone; ſo <hi>vice verſâ.</hi> Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth ambition where it cometh, it emptieth the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all its fulneſſe in the will, in the deſires; and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition keepeth out faith; as that which will empty a man, will take down every high thought, will captivate every deſire to the Lord Jeſus.</p>

They would be eſteemed thus and thus, or elſe they will not care for Chriſt.

Men, if they will put away from them a thing that is filthy, and what they abhor; they will not touch it ſcarce with a long fork, ſo God reſiſts the proud afar off. Though it may be embalmed with ſome name of honour, and though covered with excuſes, all will not hide it from him. Therefore no marvel, Brethren, if it be a great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

the Ordinances, &amp;c. and for any man to tell him of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a loathſome undone eſtate, notwithſtanding all this, he can no more receive it then the <hi>Phariſees</hi> could. What is the reaſon? Alas, his ſeeking of honour among men. What? they accept of freedome from the Lord Jeſus, who are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.33</note> and never were in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to this day? Shall they acknowledge themſelves to be in bondage? They will not ſtaine their own glory ſo, as to look upon themſelves as ſuch. I tell you Brethren, I doubt thouſands of ſoules periſh upon this account. They will be accounted the Lords people, and all holy, and have no difference made between the precious and the vile: And others do account them ſo, and receive them as ſuch, though never ſo vile. And doth not this ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, while they thus receive honour one of another? one thinketh well of another, and he as well of him, and ſo both are kept off from beleeving, from coming to Jeſus Chriſt, from cloſing with him.</p>
               <p>Look we among Profeſſours, Brethren, and is there not an abundance of this ſeeking of honour one of another? Do they not many times claw one another to an high conceit one of another? Do they not affect great ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling titles of honour, that never were duly put upon them? Was not this one of the great ſinnes of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees?</hi> they loved to be called <hi>Rabbi, Rabbi;</hi> Maſter, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: Was not this a ſeeking of honour from men? and did not this keep them off from Chriſt? did not this ſeale them up? and then the Lord knew them afarre off. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I envy no mans titles of honour that are due and juſtly his: but I cannot but take notice what affectation there is of titles of honor amongſt us. Except men be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in their titles many ſteps higher then ever their deſarts
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59506:10"/>
carried them, they are not honoured. Look to it Brethren. I thought, and I am ſure it hath been profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſome, they have done much to pull down theſe things. But (for ought I ſee) the ſpleene was more at the Perſons who had them, then the titles themſelves. Why? we deſire them not, you'l ſay; we cannot help it, if they will put it upon us.</p>
               <p>Say you ſo Brethren? but take notice of your hearts; are not they more acceptable to us, and do we not take them more to favour us, who ſcratch our itching diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, then ſuch as are more ſparing in them? Minde it: do not your hearts ſometimes riſe againſt ſuch within you, that give you not all the reſpect you expect, though it is more then is due happily? and do you ſtomack this? and will you ſay you cannot help it? Will you think thus to mock God, and deceive your own ſoules? This is but a fig-leafe, not broad enough, nor thick enough to cover the nakedneſſe. If thou wert not willing, nor glad of ſuch clawing; how eaſily mighteſt thou drive away ſuch a flattering tongue, with an angry look? Be not deceived, God will not be mocked: if there were no recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there would be no thief; if there were no ambition of thoſe honours among men, there would be no ſyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, who to pleaſe them would ſay any thing. And now while it is thus, can we think this is a time of ſo much faith as we pretend to? Surely no, Brethren: you cannot beleeve while you ſeek honour thus one of another.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59506:10"/>
with the Lord Jeſus. This is moſt clear; and if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not, we muſt periſh. And if it hinder our belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but in part, ſo that we cannot ſerve him ſo much as otherwiſe we might; how much glory doth it rob him of? and how much comfort, and peace, and ſtrength, and ſweet communion with God doth it rob us of? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeech you, let us minde it a little, and ſee if we be not many of us guilty.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, he that ſeeks not the glory which is onely from God, he ſeeks honour from men; for there is ſuch a principle in man, Brethren, that there muſt be ſome approving of him, ſome to think well of him, or elſe he cannot be quiet. See how our Saviour oppoſeth them here; <hi>Ye ſeek honour one of another, and not that which is of God.</hi> If they had ſought that honour, that glory which is only from God, they had not ſought that which is of men.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.29</note> I ſuppoſe the meaning will very well be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by that parallel Scripture: He is not a <hi>Jew</hi> which is one outwardly, neither is that circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh; but he is a <hi>Jew</hi> that is one inwardly, whoſe praiſe is not of man, but of God. The <hi>Jew</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, his praiſe was of men; but the <hi>Jew</hi> inwardly, his praiſe was only of God, and not of men. So that he which never careth for the inward circumciſion, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the heart, not that of the fleſh; The meaning is, He that ſeeks not after the mortification and ſanctification of the Spirit, by the power of the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, but liveth after the fleſh only; he hath the name of a <hi>Jew,</hi> the name of a Chriſtian, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigne of the Covenant of God, and reſteth in this, and maketh his boaſt in this; this is to ſeek honour of men. What is the reaſon elſe Brethren, that ſo many follow and adhere to them, who will not, nor do make
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59506:11"/>
any ſeparation of the precious from the vile among us? becauſe alas they ſeek honour from men. If thoſe that teach them will account them for Chriſtians, ſo look on them, and accordingly receive them to all manner of communion, to all Ordinances; they never look fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, never look whether they have Chriſt within them, whether they be born of God.</p>
               <p>Ah deare friends! I wiſh none of us that have come under a narrower ſearch, and have been more ſtrictly ſifted, deceive not our ſelves in this point. If we deceive men, minde it, God is not deceived: O how will ſome take on, if the people of God look not upon them as ſuch, as godly, as fear him. But though they live much without God, enjoying him not in his Ordinances, nor without them; though they live in much cloſe and ſecret hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and iniquity, they never take on for this. Is not this to ſeek the honour of men, and not that glory which is only of God, that inward glory, that inward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of the ſoul and conſcience to him?</p>
               <p>Secondly, if there be any among us, (Brethren) that teach the peopl, that we would reign in mens conſciences, and be accounted as Gods, take upon us his priviledges; when all we ſay muſt be Goſpel, though happily not a word in the Goſpel to prove it: when we expect that our own dictates uttered from us, ſhould be believed without any authority from the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: Is not this ſeeking of honour from men with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? If we are ready to take it ill, if our bare affirmations be not more beleeved then all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reaſon produced by another to never ſo good purpoſe: Are we guilty any of us herein? we ſeek the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which is of men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he that ſpeaks of himſelf, (our Saviour ſaith)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59506:11"/>
ſeeks his own glory, <gap reason="foreign">

Let us not be ſo ſilly as to ſwallow down any mans opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is thus and thus holy in any appearance. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil never deceiveth ſo dangerouſly, as when he is like an Angel of light. But judge according to the rule that Jeſus Chriſt hath given us to judge; He that ſpeaks of himſelf, and from himſelfe, he ſeeks his own glory, he would be ſingular, he would be ſomewhat more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and by that meanes be ſome body. Alas, were it not for ſome ſingularities of opinion, there are many whoſe honour would hardly ever reach its preſent pitch it is at. Is not this a ſeeking of honour which is of men? look to it, try your ſelves Brethren.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, for a man to hold any opinion or practice, becauſe it pleaſeth the people, is of account with them, is to ſeek the honour which is of men. Doubtleſs, this was the great reaſon wherefore the Jewes would not beleeve in the Lord Jeſus; it croſſed the old doctrine (as they thought) which they had received, and would have been looked upon as innovators, and therefore they made their boaſts, <hi>We are Moſes his Diſciples.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 9.26.</note> We have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tiquity on our ſide, though they were miſtaken, as our Saviour tells them. For if they had been his Diſciples, they would have beleeved what he wrote <hi>concerning Him.</hi> He that hath no better grounds for his opinion, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes then this, Becauſe it is <hi>pleaſing to the people;</hi> he ſeeks the honour of men. He that hath no better grounds for it, but this, is the maine thing that moveth, or elſe he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59506:12"/>
would eaſily forſake his other grounds, he ſeeks the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of men: let us look narrowly to our hearts.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, when a man wil ſomtimes ſpeak meanly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp; of his own unworthineſs, on purpoſe to draw from others a commendation of himſelf: is not this to ſeek the praiſe of men more then the praiſe of God? Are there not ſome hearts that will ſeem to lament theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, that they never lament before the Lord, and complaine much more of their hearts before men, then before him? Is not this to ſeek the praiſe of men more then the praiſe of God?<note place="margin">Iſa. 57.15.</note> God loveth and delighteth in, dwelleth with, and approveth of the humble broken ſoule that lieth low before him indeed, in ſecret that mournes for his abominations. Now when a man ſhall have little of this, and many times will be ſpeaking to others meanly of himſelf, to give them occaſion to ſpeak better of him; is not this hypocriſie? is not this to love the praiſe of men more then the praiſe of God? Beloved, many times a man will ſpeak ſo meanly of himſelf, as if another ſhould ſpeak half ſo much of him, what unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would there be taken? what alienation would there be in affection? Oh the myſtery of iniquity that is in the heart! Brethren, except we look narrowly to it, it is that which will undo us.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, doſt thou chew the cud upon any commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is paſt upon thee, and roll it up and down under thy tongue, as a ſweet morſel? Oh what nou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riſhment here is for this pride to feed upon? ſuch a one thinketh well of me, ſpeaketh well of me, and ſuch a one ſaith ſo and ſo of me, that am thus low and heavenly, another <hi>Moſes</hi> for Meekneſſe, another <hi>Solomon</hi> for Wiſdome, another <hi>Job</hi> for Patience, another <hi>Joſeph</hi> for Chaſtity, another <hi>John</hi> for Love. Oh! how doth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59506:12"/>
the heart feed upon this, chews it in ſecret, delights to call it to remembrance again and again? Is it not thus with us Brethren? and is not this to ſeek the honour that is of men, to ſeek honour one of another?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, he that ſeeks more after gifts and parts, then after Grace, Brethren, ſeeks the honour which is of men. For men uſually judge according to others gifts, and not their faith, which is the hidden man of the heart, and not diſcernable. Oh how earneſt are ſome of us after the gift of prayer, the gift of prophecie, and why? That we might ſet forth our ſelves to men; not to edifie our brethren, not that we might have more communion with God our ſelves. I muſt confeſſe, <hi>To covet, and that earneſtly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.31.</note> 
                  <hi>the beſt gifts,</hi> is a duty, and rather the gift of prophecie. But for what end? To edifie. I ſhew you a more excellent way, That is to ſay, <hi>Love,</hi> without which all knowledge and tongues, and gifts are nothing, for it is love that edifies. Oh! here ſearch your hearts with candles, for a mans ends lie deep, as the marrow in the bones lie deepeſt, and moſt hard to be diſcovered, beg of God by his Spirit to ſearch you, try you herein, elſe we ſhall be deceived. But you will ſay, But do we not deſire gifts not to edifie others? for that is a ſweet frame of Spirit, that would not be for himſelf alone, but for others as well as himſelf: But is it not that we might be ſome body, might be renowned? and minde not ſo much growing in faith, in love, in humility, in ſelf-denial, in the graces of the Spirit which are the main things, and without which the reſt are nothing? I am afraid herein we fail m ny of us very much.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, you may know Brethren, whether we ſeek honour one of another; if there be in us a ſpirit envying others well ſpoken of; if more then our ſelves, we cannot endure it, and take every commendation of another to be a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59506:13"/>
diſcommendation of our ſelves. It argues we place much of felicity in it, elſe we ſhould not envy them for it: for we envy only for ſome excellency, and therefore you ſhall finde ſuch a one with his <hi>Buts;</hi> he is ſo wiſe, and ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but he failes in another point. Oh Brethren! when one member is honoured, all the reſt ſhould rejoyce. Shall one member envy,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.26</note> becauſe another is honoured, becauſe more honour is put upon the head, then upon the hand, or foot, ſhall they envy? no, but they ſhould rejoyce in it. A ſhoe of leather becomes the foot as well as a Beaver doth the head. Shall our eye be evil, becauſe that Gods eye is good? Ah! that is a ſweet ſpirit indeed, that is a man of another ſpirit; that can, when another is honoured more in the work of Chriſt then himſelf, bleſs the Lord; can rejoyce in it, that the Lord hath any fit to honour him, though himſelf be notable to do it. This is not to ſeek the honor which is of men, but the praiſe which is of God,</p>
               <p>Ninthly, it is an argument, That a man ſeeks the honour of men too much, when he cannot go on cheerfully with the work of Chriſt, if he have not the applauſe of men. When a man hath it, and is great in the eyes of men, and they lift him up, and he is lifted up in his own heart, then he goes on with a full ſaile in the wayes of God, and his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he is called to: but alas let that ceaſe from him, and his ſpirit is down and flags; And what's the reaſon of this? Alas poore creature, he was ready to think it was the breathings of the Spirit of God that fill'd his ſails, and it was nothing but a little popular breath. Take it away, and the ſailes fall flat, there is no motion any more; When the affections of a people toward a man are the chariot wheels; take them but off; he drives ſadly and heavily, as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> chariots did. Ah poor ſoul! This is their pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they will not ſerve the Lord, cannot walk nor work
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59506:13"/>
his works, except they have their penny, except they be ſo, and ſo thought of, have ſo much, and ſo much the hearts of his people. Well, ſuch they have their penny, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.9. But it is their all, and a poore reward it is, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeaks; it will not ſerve at the laſt day; when they caſt up their reckonings, they will finde it to be a poore thing. Saith <hi>Luther, Haud velim gloriâ aut nomine vehi, majus enim gaudium in maledictis &amp; blaſphemiis.</hi> Well, this is our condition; the Lord make us ſenſible of this deceit of our hearts. I doubt, if we were well ſearched, many of us would be found guilty before the Lord; to be ſuch as ſeek the honour that is of man, and therefore our faith muſt be of neceſſity hindred. How can ye believe, &amp;c?</p>
               <p>Tenthly, a man that careth not what becometh of him, ſo he have honour from men. So <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30 Honour me now before the people.</p>

What ever parts, or abilities, or gifts the Lord hath given any of us; they are not our own, but for the good of his people: only the ſincerity of our heart in the managing of them is our own. Now while we have hearts lifted up in us, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. becauſe of them, where is the ſincerity; for ſo ſaith the Spirit of God, whoſe heart is lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, is not right within him: ſo that (alas) poor creatures, when we ſeek our own glory, by our parts, or gifts, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſetteth us off in the eyes of men, and not the glory of the Lord Jeſus; we boaſt of that which is not our own, are proud of that which we have received, and ſpend it upon our own luſts, upon our own pride and ambition. This is the reaſon wherefore the Lord denieth ſuch parts to many that deſire them to their own hurt, not knowing the baſeneſſe of their own hearts. Oh therefore, let us ſtudy our own hearts Brethren, in this particular, and what ever men ſpeak of us, look to it that it be found within us, that it be good, built not upon their ſayings, upon their charitable thoughts, but upon what we finde upon ſerious ſearching of our own hearts. Be ſure to make it your great work, to grow inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

For what will it availe us, to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p>The ſecond Branch of this Exhortation ſhall be to take heed then of laying ſnares in one anothers wayes. I mean by loading a poore creature with honour and reſpect. It may be that which may undo him, away then with this baſe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in ſwelling and undeſerved titles that is amongſt us. If ſuch as will have honour amongſt men ſeek it, let them ſeek, but not finde. If there were no flatterers, ambition would quickly flatten; bring not fuel to the fire, but rather caſt on water. You had more need Brethren, ſtil to be putting on one another in minde of ſomething to humble us, then feeding one anothers humour with honours. What doeſt thou know but the applauſe and honour thou through flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery putteſt upon ſuch a one, may be the deadly ſnare to his ſoul, to undo him for ever? for if it lift him up, and the Lord then know him afar off, what is become of him then? It is a great folly in us to think it is any advantage to any man, or to our ſelves, to flatter them into any high conceit of themſelves, to puffe them up with great titles and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; for if they be puffed up, their hearts are not right within them, and what then can you expect from them? Ah Brethren, you that know how catching corruption is, what tinder it is, that will take the leaſt ſpark! for Chriſts ſake be more tender one of anothers ſouls. I know indeed in ſome
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59506:15"/>

Therefore take heed of this.</p>

For my own part, if I ſee a man that hath no care of his name, let people ſpeak well or ill, never heedeth it, like <hi>Gallio,</hi> careth not for any of theſe things; I ſhould be afraid ſuch a one careth not for his conſcience, neither to keep a good conſcience before God, nor before men: or towards men as well as towards God. Therefore take heed of this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such evil ſpeakings of thee, are a chaſtiſement, a rod: can <hi>Shimei</hi> curſe <hi>David,</hi> and the Lord hath not bidden him curſe? Can a dog move his tongue againſt them, and the Lords hand is not in it? Can a man be outed of the hearts of the people of God, and he hath not done it?

               <p n="2">2.

Alas, what ſhall I do, might one ſay? I thought ſomething was the matter, that I could not believe in the Lord Jeſus, and now I ſee what is the matter.

               <p>For anſwer to this: 1. The beſt of Gods people have ſome of this corruption remaining in them, Brethren; ſome more, and ſome leſs. It is not thy caſe alone. There is a deſire of vain-glory at the bottom, &amp; many times we are not aware of it. Sometime we feel it ſenſibly. Therefore it is poſſible thou mayeſt be a beleever, though it be thus with thee. It is not the having, but the affecting of this, or any other ſinne that ſtands not with the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a contrary principle within that ſtrives againſt it, at leaſt where it is known. And is it not ſo with thee? Is it not thy burden? is it not thy trouble?
